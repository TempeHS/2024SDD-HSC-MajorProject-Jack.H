# How To Play
## Moving

THIS GAME IS ONLY COMPATIBLE ON MOBILE DEVICES IN PORTRAIT MODE

In order to move the ball (the player character), you must physically tilt your device to move it along the x- and y-axis.
If you're on an iOS device, in order to make this work, must go in to settings first and click on "iOS Support".

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to go inside of the "goal" circle seen in the bottom right of the screen. Entering this goal will cause the game to load a new, harder, level.
