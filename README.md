# How To Play
## Moving

THIS GAME IS ONLY COMPATIBLE ON MOBILE DEVICES IN PORTRAIT MODE

In order to move the ball (the player character), you must physically tilt your device to move it along the x- and y-axis.
If you're on an iOS device, in order to make this work, must go in to settings first and click on "iOS Support".

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to go inside of the "goal" circle seen in the bottom right of the screen. Entering this goal will cause the game to load a new, harder, level. You may also notice the ball, and other obstacles, getting slightly smaller upon completing a level, which stops at level 30.

To add difficulty to the gameplay, a number of obstacles have been added, including diamonds (which end your game upon contact), walls (which stop you from moving past them), mines (which bounce you off of them), and a variant of the diamond which moves around on a track.
