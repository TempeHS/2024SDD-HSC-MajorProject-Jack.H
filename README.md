# How To Play
## Moving

THIS GAME IS ONLY COMPATIBLE ON MOBILE DEVICES IN PORTRAIT MODE

In order to move the ball (the player character), you must physically tilt your device to move it along the x- and y-axis.
If you're on an iOS device, in order to make this work, must go in to settings first and click on "iOS Support".

## Gameplay

Gameplay is also briefly explained in the "Tutorial" page.

The objective of the game is to go inside of the "goal" circle seen in the bottom right of the screen. Entering this goal will cause the game to load a new, harder, level. You may also notice the ball, and other obstacles, getting slightly smaller upon completing a level, which stops at level 30.

To add difficulty to the gameplay, a number of obstacles have been added, including diamonds (which end your game upon contact), walls (which stop you from moving past them), mines (which bounce you off of them), and a variant of the diamond which moves around on a track.

## Recalibration

If you feel you need to change the default phone orientation to a different position, you can enter the pause menu and click the "Recalibrate" button which will change the default position to what your phone is currently in.

## Settings

Here you can change the theme and ball coulor. Changing the theme also resets the ball, so you'll need to set it again to keep your preference. This will change every screen to the new theme.
This page is also where the iOS Support button is located.

## Sign-In and Stats

The Sign-In page does not save an online account, but rather saves your inputted username to that device. The username chosen will be the one displayed on the stats page, and as such you can have multiple seperate usernames on the stats page. 
The stats page will save the top 6 overall scores, as well as the amount of games you've played.
