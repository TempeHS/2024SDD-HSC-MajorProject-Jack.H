# Sprint Review
The new features included in this sprint ended up working very well, as the player controlled in an easily understandable way. There was the suggestion of adding a calibration button the play screen in order to not lock the player into a certain angle, which will further improve player experience. The main issue with this sprint was the time taken to complete it, which ended up being longer than I would've like due to me getting sick for a week.
