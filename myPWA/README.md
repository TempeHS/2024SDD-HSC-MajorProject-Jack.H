# Sprint Review
This was a very short sprint, due to it being right at the end of the time period allotted, and being allocated to slight fixes and small features. Despite this, I feel that the sprint delivered on what was set out to do fairly well. The sound effects did end up being somewhat delayed when used on mobile (due to the way mobile devices handle resource management), but despite that every other feature ended up being completed accurately.
