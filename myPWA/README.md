## Agile Artefacts
# Sprint Backlog List of Achievables (changes made)
* ~~Diamond obstacle is drawn~~
* ~~Wall obstacle is drawn~~
* ~~Mine obstacle is drawn~~
* ~~Level generates randomly~~
* ~~More obstacles are added at higher levels~~
* ~~Obstacles interact with player~~
* ~~Diamond obstacle gains a moving variant~~
# Increment (what must be finished)
* ~~Diamond obstacle destroys player and ends their game~~
* ~~Wall obstacle prevents players from moving through it~~
* ~~Mine obstacle moves the player quickly~~
* ~~Level generation is random~~
* ~~Levels get harder at higher scores~~
* ~~Obstacles get smaller with the player~~
# Sprint Review
This sprint both took the longest to complet, and was the hardest to finish out of all of them. This was generally to be expected due to the large amount of features which were added, and the relative complexities of these features. While everything was mostly done, this has been the only sprint where there were general catches to the finished product. For example, the hitboxes on all of these obstacles is generally strange, due to the difficulties of building a collision detection system from scratch. In terms of the generation, while it does create unique layouts, it also makes a lot of impossible ones, but this may not be a problem I will be able to solve in the short time left.
