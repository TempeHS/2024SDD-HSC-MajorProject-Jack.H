# Sprint Review
This is the final sprint before gameplay is to be implimented, and the menu ended up working great. Time management so far has been going very well, as all the needed parts before gameplay are already finished. There was a problem pointed out with one of the testers for this sprint, as when loading the app initially the default coulors are shown, potentially causing discomfort when on darker themes, but that can be easily fixed next sprint.
