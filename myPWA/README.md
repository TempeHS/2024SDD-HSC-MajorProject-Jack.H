# Sprint Review
Overall this sprint ended up working very well, and the temporary text box needed to test this sprint is unobtrusive and easy to remove.
There were still complications as the HTML sanitizer in its current form ended up being complicated and using code I have not worked with before, meaning that it will be pushed back, potentially indefinitely.
Besides that, the sign-in page and score pages work properly and look fine.
